This will execute the code and print the subscription combinations for the given budget and newspapers to the terminal.

The find_subscription_combinations function takes in a budget (a float) and a list of Newspaper objects. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the names of two newspapers that can be subscribed to within the given budget.

The function works by iterating over all pairs of newspapers and calculating the total price of subscribing to both of them. If the total price is less than or equal to the budget, the combination is added to the list of combinations.

The Npaper class has two attributes: name (a string) and prices (a list of floats). The name attribute stores the name of the newspaper and the prices attribute stores the subscription prices for the newspaper for each day of the week.

The code includes two test cases that are commented out to verify the functionality of the find_subscription_combinations function. The first test case has a budget of 40 and the second test case has a budget of 35.

The program also takes the input Budget
